### Recurrence Relations

## We have,
T(0) = 0
T(n) = 1 + T(n-2)

## Then, 
T(n) = 1 + (1 + T(n-4)) = 1 + (1 + (1 + T(n-6)))
T(n) = k + T(n-2k) = n/2 + T(0) = n/2 + 0 = n/2

## The constant C would change according to the knew constant k, but x_0 would not change, unless we change the value of T(0).
