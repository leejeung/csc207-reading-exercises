For (A), it does not give an error because i, which is C, is a I and both I and C contain the method foo();
For (B), it gives an complier error because I does not contain bar();
Both lines of code will type check and also pass.

This excercise shows that subtyping is not so precise, because, under certain circumstances, type check will fail to detect missing methods.
