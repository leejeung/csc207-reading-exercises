1. Entering the loop
    When we are entering the loop, we have not made any comparison yet. So ret equals the first element of the passed array
    ret = arr[0]
2. At the end of iteration of the loop
    After the comparison, if we found a value which is bigger than the current ret, we need to assigned the new value to the ret. 
    In the example, This is done in opposite way, which is essentially finding the min. So the conditional statement in the loop
    needs to be (arr[i] > ret)
3. After execution
    Satisfying two rules implies the assignment of the maximum value in the array to ret.
    So ret has the maximum value of the array.
